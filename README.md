Linked List Visualizer is an interactive web application

Linked List Visualizer is an interactive web application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that allows users to visually understand and manipulate linked list data structures. The application provides an intuitive UI where users can perform operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal on singly linked lists in real time. With a clean and modern design, this tool is especially helpful for students, educators, and developers looking to strengthen their understanding of data structures through visual learning. It serves as a dynamic educational aid, making abstract concepts more accessible and engaging.
